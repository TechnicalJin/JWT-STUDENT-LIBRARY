# JWT Student Library Management System

## üìã Project Overview

The JWT Student Library Management System is a comprehensive microservices-based application designed to manage students, books, loans, and reservations in a library environment. The system implements JWT-based authentication and role-based access control to ensure secure operations.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project consists of three main microservices:

1. **Authentication Service** (Port 8080) - Handles user authentication and JWT token management
2. **Student Management Service** (Port 8081) - Manages student information and profiles
3. **Library Management Service** (Port 8082) - Manages books, loans, and reservations

### üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot 3.4.4
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Security**: Spring Security 6
- **Database**: MySQL
- **ORM**: JPA/Hibernate
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Java Version**: 17
- **Additional Libraries**: 
  - Lombok for boilerplate code reduction
  - MapStruct for object mapping
  - Jackson for JSON processing
  - Validation API for request validation

### üéØ Key Features

- **Multi-service Architecture**: Modular design with separate services for different domains
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication system
- **Role-based Access Control**: Support for ADMIN, LIBRARIAN, STUDENT, and USER roles
- **Book Management**: Complete CRUD operations for library books
- **Student Management**: Comprehensive student profile management
- **Loan System**: Book checkout and return functionality
- **Reservation System**: Book reservation with approval workflow
- **Inter-service Communication**: RESTful APIs for service-to-service communication

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Configuration

Each service uses its own MySQL database:
- Authentication Service: `stu_jwt`
- Student Management: `student_management`
- Library Management: `library`

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- MySQL 8.0+
- Git

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TechnicalJin/JWT-STUDENT-LIBRARY.git
   cd JWT-STUDENT-LIBRARY
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   Create the required databases in MySQL:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE stu_jwt;
   CREATE DATABASE student_management;
   CREATE DATABASE library;
   ```

3. **Configure Database Connection**
   Update the database credentials in the `application.properties` files for each service:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

4. **Build and Run Services**
   
   Start each service in separate terminals:
   
   **Authentication Service (Port 8080):**
   ```bash
   cd authentication
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   
   **Student Management Service (Port 8081):**
   ```bash
   cd management
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   
   **Library Management Service (Port 8082):**
   ```bash
   cd library
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### üîê Authentication Flow

1. Register a new user or student
2. Login to receive JWT tokens (access token and refresh token)
3. Include the access token in the Authorization header for subsequent requests
4. Use the refresh token to obtain new access tokens when they expire
